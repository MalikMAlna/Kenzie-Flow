TO DO ---------

Display messages of fun stuff to do/read/watch on breaks

Timer animation (bar that spans across page as timer gets near the end)

Track the tasks the user writes in (to-do list)

Work with Slack to change their status to either working or breaking

Settings tab to change timing (ASK!)


ISSUES ---------

Compatibility (safari)
Footer border collides with Long break button
Variable names not unique enough (maybe?)
